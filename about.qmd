I am currently a second-year research master student in the Modern History and International Relations program at University of Groningen, Netherlands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. While attending Sequoia High School, I balanced the IB Diploma Programme with competitive soccer and school sports.

After graduating from Sequoia, I attended UC San Diego in La Jolla, California. At UCSD, I majored in Political Science/International Relations and earned minors in History and Global Health.

After graduating with my BA in 2023, I spent a year working as a paraeducator for a local public school district while completing the four-course R for Data Analytics certificate program through UC San Diego Division of Extended Studies.
