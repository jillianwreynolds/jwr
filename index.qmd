# Bio

I am currently a second-year research master student in the Modern History and International Relations program at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. A research master is a two-year, research-focused program for students interested in pursuing a PhD or career in research.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After graduating high school and completing the IB Diploma Programme, I attended UC San Diego in La Jolla, California. At UCSD, I majored in Political Science/International Relations and earned minors in History and Global Health.

After earning my BA in 2023, I spent a year working as a paraeducator for a local public school district while completing the four-course [R for Data Analytics](https://extendedstudies.ucsd.edu/certificates/r-for-data-analytics){.plain-link title="Go to https://extendedstudies.ucsd.edu/certificates/r-for-data-analytics"} certificate program through UC San Diego Division of Extended Studies.

The children at the home came from around the country and were awaiting or recovering from medical treatment in Beijing.
