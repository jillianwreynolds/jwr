    "text": "I am currently researching affective polarization, civic duty, and voter turnout. The literature is inconclusive regarding a (clear) relationship between affective polarization and turnout. I theorize that civic duty may help explain the relationship by acting as a mediator.\nMy research interests include:\n\nAffective polarization, also ideological and geographic polarization\nPublic opinion\nPolitical behavior\nState comparative politics\nCalifornia politics\n\n\n\n\nClimate Policies by State"
